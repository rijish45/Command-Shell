Hello, and welcome to my Command-Shell. In this project, I have implemented all the required features till step 3 of the project desciption.
In the future, I plan to add piping and re-direction features to this command shell.

In this document, I'm listing the output of the test cases one by one and justifying the behaviour of my command shell.

Step 1: Read a command name and, run it
-------------------------------------------------------



Case 1: Run ./myShell < testcases/test01.txt 
Program Behaviour:
myShell:/Users/rijishganguly/Desktop/Project $ README.md		myShelltestcases
TESTING.txt		myShell.cpp
commandShell.txt	myShell.h
Program exited with status 0
myShell:/Users/rijishganguly/Desktop/Project $ 

The program behaviour is justified as test01.txt had the command /bin/ls. It prints the content of the current directory
and then exits. After the first program exits, we get another shell prompt for our next command. As the next command in the text file is EOF,
the program exits.


Case 2: Run ./myShell < testcases/test02.txt 
Program Behaviour:
myShell:/Users/rijishganguly/Desktop/Project $ total 488
drwxr-xr-x  11 rijishganguly  staff   352B Dec  7 23:08 .
drwx------+  5 rijishganguly  staff   160B Dec  5 19:02 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 rijishganguly  staff   6.0K Dec  6 21:01 .DS_Store
drwxr-xr-x  12 rijishganguly  staff   384B Dec  7 19:37 .git
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff   2.4K Dec  7 19:36 README.md
-rw-r--r--@  1 rijishganguly  staff   991B Dec  7 23:14 TESTING.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff   6.9K Dec  6 15:46 commandShell.txt
-rwxr-xr-x   1 rijishganguly  staff   199K Dec  7 23:06 myShell
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff    14K Dec  7 20:40 myShell.cpp
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff   1.3K Dec  7 19:08 myShell.h
drwxr-xr-x   4 rijishganguly  staff   128B Dec  7 23:15 testcases
Program exited with status 0
myShell:/Users/rijishganguly/Desktop/Project $ 

The program behaviour is justified as the commamd in the text file was /bin/ls -alh. Here the ls program takes the parameters
-alh which lists out all the direcory entries, evaluates the file information and prints them in a human readable manner. After the first program exits, we get another shell prompt for our next command. As the next command in the text file is EOF, the program exits.


Case 3: Run ./myShell < testcases/test03.txt 
Program behaviour: 
myShell:/Users/rijishganguly/Desktop/Project $ total 488
drwxr-xr-x  11 rijishganguly  staff   352B Dec  7 23:08 .
drwx------+  5 rijishganguly  staff   160B Dec  5 19:02 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 rijishganguly  staff   6.0K Dec  6 21:01 .DS_Store
drwxr-xr-x  12 rijishganguly  staff   384B Dec  7 19:37 .git
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff   2.4K Dec  7 19:36 README.md
-rw-r--r--@  1 rijishganguly  staff   2.2K Dec  7 23:24 TESTING.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff   6.9K Dec  6 15:46 commandShell.txt
-rwxr-xr-x   1 rijishganguly  staff   199K Dec  7 23:06 myShell
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff    14K Dec  7 20:40 myShell.cpp
-rw-r--r--   1 rijishganguly  staff   1.3K Dec  7 19:08 myShell.h
drwxr-xr-x   5 rijishganguly  staff   160B Dec  7 23:25 testcases
Program exited with status 0
myShell:/Users/rijishganguly/Desktop/Project $ 

Here the program takes the same command as before but the parameters are separated by white spaces. The command in the file was /bin/ls -a -l -h.
After the first program exits, we get another shell prompt for our next command. As the next command in the text file is EOF, the program exits.


Case 4: Run ./myShell < testcases/test03.txt
Program behaviour:
